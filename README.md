# BIOSTAT 625 Project: Cost Analysis and Forecasting for Hospital Financial Performance

## Overview

This project analyzes and forecasts hospital financial performance using the CMS Hospital Provider Cost Report dataset. By integrating advanced statistical models, machine learning techniques, and interactive visualization tools via R Shiny, this project aims to provide actionable insights into hospital operating efficiency and revenue generation. The analysis spans from 2011 to 2022, focusing on critical metrics such as the **Cost-to-Revenue Ratio** and **Revenue per Bed**.

## Key Features

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**

2. **Interactive R Shiny Application**
   - **Tab 1:** Dot Distribution Map for hospital-level financial metrics.
   - **Tab 2:** State-level aggregation of metrics with temporal trends.
   - Temporal slider and interactive pop-ups for enhanced usability.

3. **Statistical and Machine Learning Analysis**
